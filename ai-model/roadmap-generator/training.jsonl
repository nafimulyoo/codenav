A \"data\" object that contains: - \"label\": A brief title for the learning step. - Optionally, add a \"reasoning\" field explaining why this step is important. - \"resources\": An array of useful materials for that step. Each resource should include: - \"type\": The type of resource (e.g., \"Documentation\", \"Tutorial\", \"Video\"). - \"title\": A descriptive title for the resource. - \"link\": A URL to access the resource. 3. A \"position\" object with \"x\" and \"y\" coordinates (initially set to {x: 0, y: 0}). Each \"edge\" should represent a dependency or connection between two learning steps and must include: 1.

Optionally, add a \"reasoning\" field explaining the connection between the nodes. Branches: - The roadmap should allow for branches, where one learning step leads to multiple subsequent steps, representing different paths or specializations.

For example, \"Learn JavaScript Basics\" should be the first step because JavaScript is the core language used in React development. - The node \"Understand ES6\" comes after \"Learn JavaScript Basics\" because ES6 introduced important JavaScript features (like classes and arrow functions) that are widely used in React. - The node \"Learn React Basics\" is introduced after mastering JavaScript and ES6, as these skills are prerequisites for understanding React's component-based architecture. - Resources are chosen based on their reliability and relevance. For example, MDN Web Docs is included as a \"Documentation\" resource because it is a trusted source for JavaScript information. Tutorials and videos are also included to provide practical and visual learning experiences. - Edges represent the logical progression from one learning step to the next. For example, the edge from \"Learn JavaScript Basics\" to \"Understand ES6\" indicates that understanding ES6 builds on basic JavaScript knowledge. - Each node ID is unique and is used in edges to define relationships between different learning steps.

Logic: - The roadmap should begin with foundational knowledge that is essential for understanding subsequent topics. For example, \"Learn JavaScript Basics\" should be the first step because JavaScript is the core language used in React development. - The node \"Understand ES6\" comes after \"Learn JavaScript Basics\" because ES6 introduced important JavaScript features (like classes and arrow functions) that are widely used in React. - The node \"Learn React Basics\" is introduced after mastering JavaScript and ES6, as these skills are prerequisites for understanding React's component-based architecture. - Resources are chosen based on their reliability and relevance. For example, MDN Web Docs is included as a \"Documentation\" resource because it is a trusted source for JavaScript information. Tutorials and videos are also included to provide practical and visual learning experiences. - Edges represent the logical progression from one learning step to the next. For example, the edge from \"Learn JavaScript Basics\" to \"Understand ES6\" indicates that understanding ES6 builds on basic JavaScript knowledge. - Each node ID is unique and is used in edges to define relationships between different learning steps. Your goal is to ensure that the learning roadmap is logical, comprehensive, and well-structured. Pay attention to the dependencies between topics, ensuring that foundational topics are introduced before advanced ones, and that branches logically represent different learning paths.
